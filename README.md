# CS300
## What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?


In the projects for this course we were reading data in from a csv file representing course information, 
inserting that data into the appropriate data structure (Vector, Hash Table, Binary Search Tree), 
sorting the data structure, and then printing sorted data in a user friendly way.

## How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

I approached the problem with consideration towards striking a balance between time complexity and memory complexity.
The way data is stored and accessed in our programs is one of the most important factors in determining how performant
our code is. Optimizing the performance of our applications, regardless of the target hardware, is one of the most
important tasks when developing applications for a variety of often unknown hardware configurations.

## How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

The only major blockers during this time were time related, due to working two jobs in / adjacent to retail during the holiday season. 
The majority of the final program and its implementation of a BST only required a couple of hours from initial development to final build. 
I do believe it would benefit from further attention to detail and will perform a code review and refactor at a later date.

## How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

This project enhanced my understanding of C++ in an invaluable way, especially as I proceed deeper into my CS and GPD degrees.
While I have experience with C++ through other courses in both programs, none have touched on the data structures that will be
among the most common to be implemented in my later projects. I also intend to complete the optional material, covering AVL Trees
and Red-Black Trees, during this break.

## How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

This project reinforced my coding habits, ensuring that I maintain clear documentation of changes as I make them within my code, 
that my variable names are both consistent in naming convention and clearly understandable as representative of the data they are holding.
